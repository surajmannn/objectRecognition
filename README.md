# Object Recognition from Images using Machine Learning (Jupyter)

Crafting a classic machine learning solution for an object recognition task. each object is a 28x28 pixel image. The images are 'flattened' 784-dimensional vectors, each tagged with a label (+1 or -1). This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the object labels.
